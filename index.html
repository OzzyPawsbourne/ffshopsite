                <h1>History of the Filipino Cuisine</h1>
                <p style = "text-align: center;">
                More than 300 years ago, long before Spanish conquistadores staggered down their ships to kiss the shores of the islands,
                <br>Filipinos were rowing out to sea in their little bancas, wading knee-deep in rice paddies, planting in their backyards and
                <br>hunting in the woods. Whatever they gathered and caught they simply roasted, boiled or broiled over an open fire.
                <br>The forests were abundant and the surrounding waters teeming with life; the Filipinos' idea of food included everything
                <br>nature had to offer. Preferably seafood. Preferably fresh. Squirming, leaping, crawling-out-of-the-cooking-pot fresh.
                <br>

                <br>Foreign trade during those times was healthy and a good deal less complicated than today. The Malaysians, Indonesians,
                <br>Arabians, Indians, and Chinese brought all sorts of spices and food plants to the islands. Some of them stayed and raised
                <br>families here, and handed down cooking methods which the natives used to improve their own methods.
                <br>

                <br>Filipino cuisine is much like the Filipino himself: a mixture of different cultures, Eastern and Western, that forms one
                <br>unique culture that is like yet unlike those that preceded it. Throughout the centuries foreigners came, as traders or
                <br>conquerors, and brought with them their tastes and cooking styles, which the Filipinos adapted to their own essentially
                <br>Malayan cuisine.
                <br>
